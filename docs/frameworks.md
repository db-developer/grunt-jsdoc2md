## frameworks ##

### [grunt](https://gruntjs.com "Homepage of grunt") ###

A framework for getting tasks done. Tasks can be testing, building, packaging, whatever.

### [eslint](https://eslint.org/) ###

Find Problems  
ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.  

Fix Automatically  
Many problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed. ESLint fixes are syntax-aware so you won't experience errors introduced by traditional find-and-replace algorithms.  

Customize  
Preprocess code, use custom parsers, and write your own rules that work alongside ESLint's built-in rules. You can customize ESLint to work exactly the way you need it for your project.

### [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) ###

Testing framework.

### [expect.js](https://github.com/Automattic/expect.js) ###

Assertion framework for unit testing.

### [nyc (was:istanbul)](https://istanbul.js.org/) ###

Code coverage. [See code coverage for mocha](https://istanbul.js.org/docs/tutorials/mocha/)

### [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) ###
Part of the plugins build process, used for code bundling.

### [webpack.js](https://webpack.js.org/) ###
Alternative code bundler. Feel free to switcg the build process, if you prefer webpack.  
Be aware, this might need adjustments or fixes. It has not been tested for a while :)

### [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) ###
This module provides source map support for stack traces in node via the V8 stack trace API.
